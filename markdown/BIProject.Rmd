## Setup Chunk

**Note:** the following KnitR options have been set as the global defaults: <BR> `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE, collapse = FALSE, tidy = TRUE)`.

More KnitR options are documented here <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-options.html> and here <https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(formatR)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	warning = FALSE,
	collapse = FALSE
)
```

## Loading the Dataset

The dataset that was used is available here: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1igmH49mZiY3VWKHt21AvFFe-3kFRWsub?usp=sharing>

```{r Dataset Loader}
library(readr)

    col_types = cols(
        Proj_Sec0 = col_number(), 
        Proj_Sec1 = col_number(), Proj_Sec2 = col_number(), 
        Proj_Sec3 = col_number(), Proj_Sec4 = col_number(), 
        Proj_Sec5 = col_number(), Proj_Sec6 = col_number(),

## Boilerplate below:

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
